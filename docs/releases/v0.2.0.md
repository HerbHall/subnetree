# v0.2.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 2026
**Tag:** `v0.2.0`

## Overview

v0.2.0 is the first feature release after the alpha. Every core module is now
fully implemented -- Pulse monitoring, Insight analytics, LLM integration,
credential Vault, and Gateway remote access all ship with real functionality
and comprehensive test coverage (398 new tests).

## New Modules

### Pulse -- Device Monitoring (80 tests)

- ICMP health checks with configurable intervals and timeout
- Alert state machine (OK -> Warning -> Critical -> OK) with hysteresis
- Data retention with automated maintenance loop
- Subscribes to `recon.device.discovered` for automatic check creation
- Publishes `pulse.metrics.collected` events consumed by Insight
- REST API: 6 endpoints for checks, results, alerts, and device status

### Insight -- AI-Powered Analytics (90 tests)

- Statistical algorithms: EWMA baselines, Z-score anomaly detection,
  CUSUM change-point detection, linear regression forecasting,
  cross-metric correlation
- Natural language query interface with 2-phase LLM pipeline (6 intents)
- REST API: anomalies, forecasts, baselines, NL query endpoints
- Consumes Pulse metric events for real-time analysis

### LLM -- AI Provider Integration (24 tests)

- Multi-provider architecture with pluggable backends
- Ollama provider (local inference, no external API keys required)
- Plugin wrapper with health checks and graceful degradation
- Product works fully without any LLM configured (`Required: false`)

### Vault -- Credential Encryption (120 tests)

- Argon2id key encryption key (KEK) derivation
- AES-256-GCM envelope encryption with per-credential data encryption keys
- Seal/unseal model: metadata operations work sealed, crypto requires unseal
- 7 credential types: SSH password, SSH key, SNMP v2c/v3, API key,
  HTTP basic, custom
- Master key rotation without re-encrypting all credentials
- Audit trail for all credential operations
- REST API: 13 endpoints for credential CRUD, seal/unseal, key management

### Gateway -- Remote Access (84 tests)

- HTTP reverse proxy with per-session `httputil.ReverseProxy` instances
- SSH-in-browser backend via WebSocket bidirectional bridge
- In-memory session manager with configurable max sessions and timeout
- Consumer-side `DeviceLookup` interface for device resolution
- JWT authentication via query parameter (browser WebSocket compatibility)
- Audit trail in SQLite with configurable retention
- REST API: session management, proxy traffic forwarding, status, audit

## Improvements

### Dashboard

- Fleshed out About page with version info, license, and Community Supporters
- Fleshed out Settings page with server configuration display
- Plugin lifecycle tests for Dispatch, Vault, and Gateway stubs

### Documentation

- Tailscale deployment guide: running SubNetree + Scout over Tailscale
- Tailscale Serve & Funnel guide: exposing dashboard without port forwarding
- Markdownlint compliance across all documentation

### Infrastructure

- Plugin panic recovery with graceful error handling
- Post-alpha cleanup (README, .gitignore, stale references)
- Markdownlint configuration with per-directory overrides

## Release Targets

This release establishes the following version roadmap:

| Version | Theme | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **v0.2.0** | Everything Works | All core modules functional (this release) |
| **v0.3.0** | Scout Agent | Windows agent, gRPC mTLS, Dispatch module |
| **v0.4.0** | Discovery+ | SNMP, mDNS, UPnP, enhanced alerting |
| **v0.5.0** | Multi-Tenant | TenantID, row-level isolation, MSP support |
| **v1.0.0** | Production Ready | PostgreSQL, MFA, OIDC, integrations |

## Known Limitations

- **Agent Management (Dispatch)**: Registered but no functional agents (v0.3.0)
- **Scout Agent**: Binary builds but has no production features (v0.3.0)
- **Gateway frontend**: SSH WebSocket backend works; xterm.js UI not yet built
- **Gateway RDP/VNC**: Requires Apache Guacamole sidecar (future)
- **LLM providers**: Only Ollama supported; OpenAI/Anthropic planned
- **OIDC/OAuth2**: Schema ready, provider deferred
- **LLDP/CDP/SNMP/mDNS/UPnP discovery**: Deferred to v0.4.0

## Statistics

- **398 tests** across 5 modules
- **0 new Go dependencies** for Vault, Gateway, and Insight
- **120 tests** in Vault (encryption, store, API, key management)
- **90 tests** in Insight (baselines, anomaly detection, forecasting, NL query)
- **84 tests** in Gateway (sessions, proxy, SSH, handlers, store)
- **80 tests** in Pulse (checks, alerts, retention, API handlers)
- **24 tests** in LLM (Ollama provider, plugin wrapper, contract suite)

## Getting Started

### Docker (Recommended)

```console
docker run -d --name subnetree -p 8080:8080 -v subnetree-data:/data --cap-add NET_RAW --cap-add NET_ADMIN ghcr.io/herbhall/subnetree:v0.2.0
```

### Upgrade from v0.1.0-alpha

Pull the new image and restart. Database migrations run automatically.

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/herbhall/subnetree:v0.2.0
docker stop subnetree && docker rm subnetree
docker run -d --name subnetree -p 8080:8080 -v subnetree-data:/data --cap-add NET_RAW --cap-add NET_ADMIN ghcr.io/herbhall/subnetree:v0.2.0
```
