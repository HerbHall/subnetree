## Product Vision

NetVantage is a modular, source-available network monitoring and management platform that provides unified device discovery, monitoring, remote access, credential management, and IoT awareness in a single self-hosted application.

**Strategic Intent:** Free for personal and home use forever. Built to become a commercial product for business, MSP, and enterprise use. The codebase, documentation, community, and clean IP chain are the product -- designed from day one for acquisition readiness.

**Target Users:** Home lab enthusiasts, prosumers, small business IT administrators, managed service providers (MSPs).

**Core Value Proposition:** No existing source-available tool combines device discovery, monitoring, remote access, credential management, and IoT awareness in a single product. Free for personal, home-lab, and non-competing production use. BSL 1.1 licensed core with Apache 2.0 plugin SDK for ecosystem growth.

### Design Philosophy

1. **Ease of use first.** You should not need a tech degree to operate NetVantage. The interface should be intuitive enough that a non-technical small business owner can understand their network health at a glance, while an experienced sysadmin can drill into the detail they need.

2. **Sensible defaults, deep customization.** NetVantage ships fully preconfigured for rapid deployment -- install and go. But the true power lies in the ability to configure and customize every aspect of the system: dashboards, alerts, scan schedules, notification channels, plugins, and themes. The defaults get you running; customization makes it yours.

3. **Plugin-powered extensibility.** The plugin architecture is not an afterthought -- it is the architecture. Every major feature is a plugin. Users and third-party developers can replace, extend, or supplement any module. The system is designed to be shaped by its users, not constrained by its authors.

4. **Stability and security are non-negotiable.** These are not features that ship "later." Every release must be stable enough to trust with production infrastructure and secure enough to trust with network credentials. If a feature compromises stability or security, it does not ship.

5. **Time to First Value under 10 minutes.** Users will forgive missing features but will not forgive a bad first experience. Download, install, see your network -- in minutes, not hours.
