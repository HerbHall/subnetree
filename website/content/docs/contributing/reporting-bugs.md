Found a bug? We appreciate your help in improving NetVantage.

## Before Reporting

1. **Search existing issues** -- check [open issues](https://github.com/HerbHall/netvantage/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported
2. **Reproduce the issue** -- confirm you can reproduce it reliably
3. **Update to latest** -- verify the bug exists on the latest version of `main`

## How to Report

Use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/HerbHall/netvantage/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) on GitHub.

Include the following information:

### Required
- **What happened** -- clear description of the bug
- **What you expected** -- what should have happened instead
- **Steps to reproduce** -- numbered steps to trigger the bug
- **Environment** -- OS, Go version, NetVantage version

### Helpful
- **Logs** -- relevant server or agent log output
- **Configuration** -- relevant sections of your config file (redact credentials)
- **Screenshots** -- if the bug involves the dashboard UI

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you've found a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, follow the [Security Policy](https://github.com/HerbHall/netvantage/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.

## What Happens Next

1. A maintainer will triage the issue and add appropriate labels
2. The issue will be prioritized based on severity and impact
3. You'll be notified when work begins and when a fix is available
