# v0.4.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 2026
**Tag:** `v0.4.0`

## Overview

v0.4.0 is a major feature release delivering expanded network discovery,
monitoring intelligence, AI-powered analytics with multi-provider LLM support,
mTLS agent security, and a complete documentation overhaul. 24 PRs merged
since v0.3.0.

## New Discovery Methods

### mDNS/Bonjour Discovery (PR #248)

- Passive discovery via mDNS service announcements on the local network
- Queries 14 well-known service types (HTTP, SSH, AirPlay, HomeKit, etc.)
- Automatic device upsert with hostname and service metadata
- Configurable query interval (default 5 minutes)
- Platform: Linux/macOS (Windows stub -- mDNS unreliable on Windows)

## Monitoring Enhancements

### Time-Series Metrics API (PR #243)

- Historical metrics storage with configurable retention
- Downsampling API for efficient graph rendering (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 6h, 1d)
- Per-device, per-metric time-series queries
- Dashboard metric charts with selectable time ranges

### Dependency-Aware Alert Suppression (PR #261)

- Define check dependencies (e.g., server depends on router)
- When a parent device goes down, downstream alerts are automatically suppressed
- Prevents alert storms during network outages
- Visual dependency indicators in monitoring dashboard

## AI and Analytics

### Multi-Provider LLM Support (PRs #271, #273)

- **OpenAI** provider: GPT-4o-mini default, Bearer token auth, streaming support
- **Anthropic** provider: Claude Sonnet default, x-api-key auth, content blocks
- **BYOK configuration**: Store API keys in Vault, select provider in Settings
- Settings UI: Provider dropdown, conditional fields, "Test Connection" button
- Graceful degradation: All features work without any LLM configured

### Natural Language Query Bar (PR #272)

- Dashboard widget for asking questions about your network in plain English
- Powered by configured LLM provider (Ollama, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
- Handles unconfigured state gracefully with helpful setup message
- Sparkles icon for AI branding

### AI Optimization Recommendations (PR #274)

- Threshold-based resource analysis: CPU >80%, memory >85%, disk >90%
- Severity levels: info, warning, critical
- Dashboard widget with auto-refresh (5-minute interval)
- REST API: `GET /api/v1/insight/recommendations`

## Agent Security

### mTLS Certificate Authority (PRs #207-210)

- Built-in CA for Scout agent mutual TLS authentication
- Automated certificate enrollment during agent registration
- Certificate renewal before expiration
- Secure gRPC communication between server and agents

### Linux Scout Agent (PR #262)

- Native Linux agent (x64, ARM64) with real system collectors
- CPU, memory, disk, network interface metrics
- Service discovery (systemd units, Docker containers)
- Hardware profiling (DMI/sysfs-based)

## Vault UI

### Credential Manager Frontend (PR #264)

- Full CRUD interface for managing encrypted credentials
- Device credential assignment
- Credential type filtering and search
- Audit log viewer

## Documentation Overhaul

### MkDocs Material Site (PR #270)

- Migrated from Hugo to MkDocs Material theme
- Forest green brand palette with slate scheme
- 50+ documentation pages organized into 7 navigation sections
- Table of contents with permalinks on all long documents
- Custom checkbox styling for roadmap checklists
- Search, code copy, and responsive navigation

### Guides and References (PRs #247, #265, #267, #268, #269)

- Getting Started guide with Quick Start flow
- Troubleshooting guide with common issues
- Common Tasks reference
- Quick Reference card (single-page cheat sheet)
- Platform installation notes (Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker)
- Example configuration with full documentation
- Mermaid workflow diagrams in CONTRIBUTING guide

### Project Identity (PRs #266, #275, #276)

- GitHub repository topics and metadata for discoverability
- Power monitoring research document (MQTT, SNMP PDU, electricity rates)
