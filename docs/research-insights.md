## Current Research Status
Documentation Generator confirmed as #1 priority opportunity:
- Zero direct competitors identified
- Universal pain point across HomeLab community  
- Technical feasibility validated via API research
- First-mover advantage confirmed

## Implementation Requirements (From Research)
### Phase 1: Core Documentation Module (30 days)
- Docker API integration for container discovery
- Git backend for automated configuration versioning
- Web UI documentation tab with backup/restore interface
- Plugin architecture foundation for extensibility

### Phase 2: Application Plugins (60 days) 
- Home Assistant plugin for configuration.yaml backup
- Plex/Jellyfin plugin for media server settings
- Portainer plugin for container management configs
- Community validation and feedback integration

## Technical Architecture Validated
- Docker API provides complete container inspection access
- Application APIs (Home Assistant, Jellyfin, Portainer) enable config extraction
- Git integration possible via go-git library
- Plugin system architecture confirmed feasible

## Market Intelligence
- No automated infrastructure documentation tools exist
- All current solutions (NetBox, wikis, Git) are manual-only
- Documentation ranked as critical HomeLab pain point
- Strong community demand for automation solutions
