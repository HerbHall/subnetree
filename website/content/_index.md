## Why NetVantage?

<div class="hx-mt-4">

No existing source-available tool combines device discovery, monitoring, remote access, credential management, and IoT awareness in a single product.

**One tool instead of five.** Stop stitching together Zabbix for monitoring, Netbox for inventory, Guacamole for remote access, and a password manager for credentials. NetVantage does it all.

**Free for personal use, forever.** Built for home labs, prosumers, and small business IT. The core is licensed under BSL 1.1, which converts to Apache 2.0 after 4 years. The plugin SDK is Apache 2.0 from day one.

**Time to First Value under 10 minutes.** Download, install, see your network. No complex configuration, no mandatory dependencies, no tech degree required.

**Self-hosted. Your data stays yours.** No cloud dependency. No telemetry. No vendor lock-in. Run it on your hardware, your way.
